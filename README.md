# Air_bnb-listings
This Power BI  dashboard is created using the Air BNB listing 2019 dataset which is available in kaggle.I created this dashboard after preprocessing the dataset which includes changinng datatypes,removing duplicates,errors and blank rows,replacing null values,creating calculated columns etc.Here we can derive some insights from this dashboard.Some of them are 
1. There is a significant price difference between room types.Entire house/apartment has high pricing when compared to private rooms and shared rooms.
2. We can identify top 5 active hosts in terms of listings they manage.Sonder comes the first.
3.The price in Brooklyn is less compared to Manhattan.But Brooklyn receives most guest reviews.
4. We can get the host who receives more reviews.Here David Receives more revies eventhough his listings are less.

By these insights, stakeholders can make data-driven decisions to improve their Airbnb offerings, optimize pricing strategies, enhance guest experiences, and identify market opportunities.
